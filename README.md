# Text Mining - near duplicate document detection

Goal of this project is to find near duplicates of html web pages inside a warc IO archive using different hashing algorithms and measuring their time consumption.

## Getting Started

1. Enable the virtual environment in the projects root directory with:
```
. venv/bin/activate
```

2. Create or choose a config (you can find example configs in "conf/". ) and start the main script with it as parameter:
```
python3 main.py -c path/to/config.conf
```

3. Find the results in the path specified in the config (run.output_dir)

### Prerequisites

You need to have all dependencies available. Use a virtual environment or install them manually using the pip_requirements file in the projects root directoy:
```
python3 -m venv venv --no-site-packages && . venv/bin/activate && pip3 install -r pip_requirements.txt
```

## Running the tests

There is a test script with a smaller subset of data contained in "test/". You can start it with:
```
python3 test.py
```
This enables user to get in touch with the software.
